## Setting up
These instructions are for installing Raspbian with a desktop environment using a Windows PC. After the code has been finalized we may want to install the headless Raspbian Lite to reduce [electricity consumption](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/39933).

**Installing Raspbian**

1. Follow the instructions on the official website to [download and flash Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) on an SD card.

**Enabling SSH**

2. Add a file called `ssh` to the boot directory of the SD card.

**Connecting to the NUS Wifi**

3. If you have an external monitor and keyboard, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
4. Follow instructions on the [official docs](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started/4). Then go to step 10.
5. Install Bonjour print services for windows for mDNS support. 
6. Using and HDMI cable for external display and a mouse (no keyboard needed), boot the pi. Connect to a hotspot (eg mobile, connectify) that has no password.
7. Ensure your laptop is also connected to the hotspot. Using Putty, ssh into `pi@raspberrypi.local`, default password `raspberry`.
8. Enter `passwd` to change password to `danceteam2`.
9. Install an on-screen keyboard by entering `sudo apt install matchbox-keyboard`. This will allow you to make small changes without needing to SSH.
10. Run `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`, which should update kernel drivers. If you don't do this, the raspberry pi loses connection to the internet after about 2 minutes. It remains connected to NUS_STU_2-4GHz but cannot ping the router gateway, other devices on the network, or any website. This occurs with both dynamic and static IPs. Running `dmesg` seems to indicate a broadcom driver error (brcmfmac).
11. `sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` to configure a connection to the NUS wifi network. First, hash your password by entering `echo -n plaintext_password_here | iconv -t utf16le | openssl md4` in a bash terminal. Then use the following as a template:
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=SG

network={
        ssid="NUS_STU_2-4GHz"
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        pairwise=CCMP
        auth_alg=OPEN
        eap=PEAP
        identity="nusstu\e0001111"
        password=hash:your-hashed-password
        phase1="peaplabel=0"
        phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
        priority=1
}
```

> Note: I am currently not connecting to the NUS Wifi since its difficult to figure out the pi's IP address headlessly. Instead I have set up a hotspot using Connectify, which informs me of connected devices' addresses.

**Setting a static IP (not working)**

12. Follow [these instructions](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/37920/how-do-i-set-up-networking-wifi-static-ip-address/74428#74428) to set up a static IP address with dhcpcd. Example `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`:
```
interface wlan0
static ip_address=172.31.38.121/22
static routers=172.31.36.1
static domain_name_servers=172.19.215.140 172.19.50.39
```
13. Connect to the NUS_STU_2-4GHz network on your PC and ssh into `pi@<static-ip>`. You can now SSH into the pi as long as you are connected to NUS_STU_2-4GHz (probably).

**Graphical desktop sharing**

14. Follow instructions here to [set up VNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/docs/raspberry-pi.html#setting-up-your-raspberry-pi). Using this setup does not require a static IP, just an account with RealVNC and an internet-connected pi.


## Installing Miniconda

Simple instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/simoncos/a7ce35babeaf73f512be24135c0fbafb). Note that the python version will be downgraded from 3.5 to 3.4.
